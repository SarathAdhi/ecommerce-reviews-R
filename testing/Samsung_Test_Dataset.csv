RMR51TI8DDAZ4,AJAI KUMAR S,"Â Before you buy M32 just think what type of user are you.I could see so many comments complaining about the performance of this phone. But M32 was not made for gaming or multitasking. It's for people who use mobile for normal tasks rare multitasking and mostly for content viewing.Simply it's the best display for watching movies, videos and much more. No other display can show black better than a Super AMOLED. Almost perfect colour, pitch black and almost 170Â° viewing angles.A day long battery life.What else do you need for entertainment?Probably nothing.The cameras are good at outdoor use and may struggle indoors. Audio is more than enough both for calls and content viewing. WiFi and sim signal depends on individual.***My mobile camera couldn't capture the true colours of the display. But i bet it's awesome.**Overall this is the exact phone I needed. Mostly watching movies in high resolution and perfect picture quality and occasional multitasking.So don't buy this phone if you wanna play games or do multitasking and complain in the review section.Think what you're gonna do with the phone and see the specs and then decide.",Reviewed in India on 9 August 2022,Think before you buy!!!!,4,,27,4GB RAM &amp; 64GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.

R3VMN78IQQFBRR,Utkarsh tiwari,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great.",Reviewed in India on 2 July 2021,"Feels like butter, great for everyone except hard-core gamers.

R3QTD9WKBKM0MV,Utkarsh,"From my usage over a month and taking it to a trip where network reception was absent 90% of the time, my reviews are this:-Display is great, surely compares to flagship devices, the sAMOLED Infinity-U display is really something else, bright, brilliant, vibrant and with the 90Hz refresh rate (laggy animations appear sometimes), quite responsive too. It is miles ahead from smartphones in this range.-Camera is pretty nice actually and surprised me a bit, especially from budget Samsung line, however, it does have a habit of oversaturation in some minuscule scenarios, low-light photography is average, just average as can be expected from phones of this range.-Battery is AVERAGE at best, please keep this in mind before buying, don't let the 6000mah figure fool you, for powering a display of that much calibre the battery lasts a day to a day and half depending on usage but NOT more than that in any case. The 15w charger provided requires a good 2-2.5 hours to charge up the 6000mah battery. 90hz display is a battery drainer, so I set mine on 60hz for the trip, for office/home scenario where frequent charging is not an issue 90hz is great albeit laggy animations appear sometimes.-Back panel is polymer based and is prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches, so a light case is the right way to go.-Network reception is great for both WiFi and cellular and does not suffer from the low signal issues faced by some M31 users, etc. Bluetooth works well too.-Fingerprint sensor is snappy but coming from a phone where it was present on the back, it takes time getting used to and is sometimes just a tad bit slow, nothing to worry about.-External speaker volume is bad to average, it is not at all loud, I am not criticising this, maybe a lot a of people prefer quiet phone speakers but it is sometimes hard to hear ringtone or notification sounds especially from a phone where notification LED is absent.-Always on Display is present but reduces the battery percentage 1-2% at most.Summing up the above, overall, great viewing experience, camera is alright, battery is average, speakers are disappointing.-STRICTLY NOT a performance beast by any means, great for everyday or business usage. NOT for gaming.-Have not observed heating issue as of yet.Hope this helps, Cheers!",Reviewed in India on 16 September 2021,"Great display, great camera but comes with a couple of catches",4,,15,4GB RAM &amp; 64GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

R2RO7W6ZD4DAPP,Shantanu B.,"Writing this review after almost a month of using the product.First off, I want to emphasize that the value for the product is just great.Build Quality:The body & screen are toughened and have a premium feel. The ""rainbow"" reflective back seems a bit weird to me, I would rather prefer a plain, smooth finish but that's just my personal opinion.Camera:Okay, this is probably the biggest topic to discuss on. Camera quality does not depend on the megapixels, it depends on the processing engine of the device. Megapixels are only useful for zooming in. So whether you have a 64MP phone, or a 108MP phone, the pixels don't matter. The processing engine matters (which is why the iPhone 11 with just 12MP shoots way better photos).The camera is mediocre, neither too good nor too bad. It does have a night-mode which is pretty decent. If you are into professional photography, you're better off with the Oneplus Hasselblad or the iPhone.But if you just take photos casually to post on social media, it does its job pretty well.Size & ease-of-usage:One can be a bit skeptical when using a device that is sized more than 6 inches. However, Samsung absolutely nailed the ease of use with the inbuilt scroll gesture on the power button. The power button is sort of like a laptop's touchpad, when you swipe down on the button, it will open the notification tray from where you can get access to your WiFi controls, etc. To close the menu you just have to swipe up on the power button. This is a really unique & useful idea because when you can use only one hand, it is uncomfortable to scroll through the top of the screen, but this gesture makes it super easy!Processor & Performance:Being a previous Snapdragon user, I was skeptical about moving onto the Mediatek family of processors. But given the size of RAM & storage, this device is perfect for semi-competitive gaming. Of course, you cannot expect it to perform like the Asus ROG Phone series, but you can get around 45-60fps at high graphic settings on AAA titles, which is pretty good. The 90Hz screen is fantastic too, and the gameplay experience is smooth & fluid.Screen:Not much to say here, it performs as expected. The 90Hz sAMOLED display is crisp & smooth. You also have an option to switch to 60Hz refresh rate to save battery.Battery:Just super! You can easily go for 3 days without a charge if you're not a frequent user. Medium gaming for 1 hour consumes around 6-8% battery. But if you just use it for messaging/calling/checking mails and casual gaming, the 6000mAH will easily last you for 2-3 days.Final verdict:I think that Samsung has done a really good job with the price range here. The phone offers plenty of features, which, as compared to the price are justified. If you're looking for a device around the 15k price range, go for it!",Reviewed in India on 8 October 2021,In-depth detailed Review â†“,4,,12,6GB RAM &amp; 128GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

Front Camera is good, the photos come out clear even in dim indoor light.4. Mobile doesn't hang or crash unlike previous Samsung mobiles.5. Mobile isn't too heavy & feels just right in the hand.6. Camera is great outdoors & has a number of options including Pro mode & a very decent macro mode.7. Good battery backup. Lasts a day for normal use & videos. Display is amazingly clear & the phone speakers are loud enough to be heard all over the house.Now for the not so great part:1. What's with the sheer cheap plastic sim tray? The tray broke instantly while trying to install the sim. Had to spend Rs. 800 for a new one & this was on the day the mobile arrived.2. The touch lags. It's a very obvious lag & it takes a nudge or two for the mobile to respond.3. The Camera zoom is an utter waste. Don't even bother zooming at 10x.4. Comes preinstalled with a lot of useless apps & can't remove half of them.6. 3GB of 6GB RAM is always taken. For what?4. The finger printer scanner is at the most bizarre place. It's at the right hand side, bang in the middle where it doubles as the power button. It's real crazy to use & doesn't recognize fingerprints easily.5. Charger adapter provided is not 15W, but 10W. Takes about 2 hours to charge.6. No screen protector, no ear phones, no back cover. Samsung is really saving up on the small essentials.Should you buy this phone? Sure!

The new M32 software is making me want to never invest in a Samsung phone again.There is a huge issue with the accidental touch protection feature which Samsung is failing to acknowledge.  If you have done the mistake of choosing to switch on this feature, the notification for the accidental touch protection turns on and it keeps flashing it continuously and does not let you cancel it, or log in or even turn off the phone. It makes the phone unusable for a lot of time till you push a lot of buttons, do plenty of trial and error and somehow get the phone to restart or switch off somehow.  This is a show stopper and is absolutely unacceptable for a brand new phone.This is of course in addition to pushing a whole bunch of Samsung software which are absolutely unneeded.

RE6Z4XL73MPTR,Souvik S.,The phone seems good to me. I am quite happy with it. I could have given 5 star rating. But one star less because I got a phone which display lower edge has a scratch which is not minor not major. I put a protector glass on it. Because of hand finger print it is not visible. Why samsung? Why this type of mistakes by a rrputed brand like you? Previously I got samsung galaxy tab a7 it has screen bleeding issue. I exchanged it. I got another tablet which doesn't have that issue but it side corners has marks(aluminium back) which are made when you drop it on hard surface or because of shock.

Weight of pros are above cons. If you are not a heavy gamer, just ignore low processor & emmc comments from others. They are just tech things which doesn't matter in daytoday use. Lag and ram usage reported from others is also probably due to unwanted apps. Unistall/disable them will solve the problem. Uninstall only after initial setup is done and after installing available phone update. Otherwise they will be forcefully installed again. After setup also it will try to install through Galaxy store. But it is under control if first setup done correctly ('geekyranjit M32' in youtube).Reduced 1 star only as a warning for Samsung to exclude bloatwares in upcoming models. Also they should not force to use Galaxy appstore.New Mi and Oppo models also have more bloatwares and additionally they have call recording announcement (other party will know that call is being recorded). In comparison, my recommendation is to consider M32.

However, battery life is rather poor, and the 6000 mAh battery seems like 4000 mAh, and drains quickly. Also, even though the phone runs on One UI 3.1, Samsung has throttled a lot of the features on this device, which is very disappointing.

It's display quality, camera quality and battery life are the points to consider. Yes night pic is not of that much quality and battery heats up well during charging only(keep cover off to reduce heat). Hopefully samsung will fix this heat issue through update. Battery really stays for 1.5 days for average user. For average user it really won't matter a difference for 12nm and 10 nm difference which m31 Exynos had.

R15CU7EB2UFVK8,Ravi G.,"The phone is quite slim and feels light despite the 9mm thickness.Sound Quality - The speakers are loud but lack clarity. They should have given stereo speakers.Music played via speakers or earphones are not loud enough but has clarity. Strange but true.It's mono speakers. The Dolby feature and equalizers are average.Battery - The battery lasts well. I'm a moderate user and it lasts me 4 days on each charge.Screen - I personally cannot handle the SAMOLED screen and the brightness. The glare is too much, strains the eye and head. The Eye comfort shield is not helpful at all. I can't look at the screen for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a stretch.  Too bright. Reducing the brightness also doesn't help.Otherwise, it's a great buy. Good build quality. User experience. Software. Everything is good. Too many apps automatically download from the Galaxy store.

A GSM phone is supposed to work. I even checked with the carriers who's sim cards I was using, the phone is shown compatible. However, continued issues of call drop, no data signals. Especially issue with calling was tremendous.I could hear the caller but they could not hear me due to connectivity. Several occasions where on calling someone, it never registers on the network or takes a long time to make phone call.I carried my old samsung phone for ""just-in-case"" scenario, and that is what saved me in.Eg:M32 - No Phone or Data signalOld Samsung phone - All bars of phone and strong data signalI would not recommend this phone especially if you plan to use it outside India (even for travelling proposes)",Reviewed in India on 25 July 2022,Not worth it - especially if travelling international,3,,1,6GB RAM &amp; 128GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

The same apps of my previous phone were transferred. I am always online as like before. So, the new cellphone draining the battery life shocked me.However, I strongly believe, the bug supposed to have been sent by the manufacturer to kill the battery life of the phones that are two years old, have been copied to the new phone through Smart Switch.The camera is another poor quality.

R15NNXWP8XRZGT,Amazon Customer,"For anyone looking for a non gaming phone then this has to be the best in this price segment. One of its most important feature is its massive 6000mah battery which makes it a truly 2day phone without any battery saver and without increasing the weight of the phone too much(compared with other 6000mah phones its pretty lightweight but dont compare with ur average 4000mah phones though). Most days of heavy usage with around 5-6 hrs of screen on time leaves the battery at around 50% at end of the day. Added with this is the super amoled display with 90hz refresh makes it really smooth and visually appealing for normal tasks.The only downside which is a really serious one, is its processor which is really underpowered for the price segment. You would experience slight stutters here and there during normal multitasking operations. Gaming i would believe will be a big no for this phone as u can get better performing phones for the price. The key point about this phone is that u get super amoled display at 90hz which is far far better than any lcd display even with 120hz, OneUi interface which is far better than the chinese bloated interfaces that u get with other brands in the price range and superb battery life. If these are the things that matter to you:- good software, battery life and display quality, then look no further as this is the best phone at this price point",Reviewed in India on 14 September 2021,Really solid phone for the price,5,,1,4GB RAM &amp; 64GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

The main attraction for me is the body of m32 which looks premium and strong with the use of back Glass and chrome.Display is very smooth and doesn't cause eye irritation. I felt this problem in m12. But it's display is damn good like premium phones I.e super amoled . Camera  is good though I doubt it is 64 mp.

RH8OEW5HYG8TQ,YOGESH,This phone is  strictly for a normal user with light gaming like candy crush kind of games person .My review after a week's use1. Display - 4/5. Full hd + amoled display with 90hz is the cherry on the top. Display is good no issues.2. Camera - 3.5/5. Average cameras. Daylight good photos. Videos are good in daylight. In Low light it struggles.3. Battery - 3.5/ 5 . Battery life is good with 7-8hrs of sot at 90hz. But only 15w charger in box. It takes around 2.5 hrs4. Processor - 3/5. Mtk g80 is a decent soc . It struggles to push 90hz  consistently. Atleast a helio g95 could have been better. Memory type is emmc. No ufs 2.1 or 2.2 it could have improved the overall performance of the device considerably . You can see stutters more frequently and sometimes even some random freezes.5. Software - 3/5. One ui 3.1 on Android 11 . Tons of bloatware including samsung apps. Software is not that much polished to give a feel like samsung midrange phone.My suggestion is if you are in a budget of strictly 13k and need only a samsung phone then only go for this phone . Otherwise if your are ok with the chinese counterparts then go ahead there are much better options than this phone.

RZT30W4JHCFJ9,Sree,"Review of normal daily use.Pros:- Good display- Good battery backup - atleast 2 days- Good speed - no lag- Good call clarity- Fast fingerprint scan, can add upto 3 fingers- Call recording without announcement- Adaptive eye comfort shieldCons:- Presence of bloatwares (unwanted preinstalled apps)- Speaker is not loud- No backcase providedOverall it is a good phone to have. Weight of pros are above cons. If you are not a heavy gamer, just ignore low processor & emmc comments from others. They are just tech things which doesn't matter in daytoday use. Lag and ram usage reported from others is also probably due to unwanted apps. Unistall/disable them will solve the problem. Uninstall only after initial setup is done and after installing available phone update. Otherwise they will be forcefully installed again. After setup also it will try to install through Galaxy store. But it is under control if first setup done correctly ('geekyranjit M32' in youtube).Reduced 1 star only as a warning for Samsung to exclude bloatwares in upcoming models. Also they should not force to use Galaxy appstore.New Mi and Oppo models also have more bloatwares and additionally they have call recording announcement (other party will know that call is being recorded). In comparison, my recommendation is to consider M32. If you need a phone only for normal usage, then 4GB 64GB variant is enough.",Reviewed in India on 7 July 2021,Overall good phone,4,,2,4GB RAM &amp; 64GB,Black,Samsung Galaxy M32

And the SAMSUNG M32 is EXCELLENT for her usage.The brilliant S-AMOLED Display is a treat to look at. My mother watches YT videos, Insta Reels for fun and usually stays busy on WhatsApp Video calls and social media - FB and others. And this is where this phone excels with its crisp display and long battery life.So, I'm satisfied with this purchase.

In MI phones ringtone volume is high and can here from far if a call comes.3.  Played music in normal player and Jet audio player but speaker volume is low. POCO M2 pro which I am using now have very good speaker volume and can hear properly while speaking in call in traffic and noisy locations.4. Battery drains like anything. I am using 4G and portable hotspot from morning to late evening in my POCO M2 pro in office and 10-20% battery charge will remain in late evening. But in samsung M32 battery dies quickly.5.

RD4ZGRVYCD15M,Janani K,Cannot make calls or receive calls most of the time. There is some issue with the device itself. Have to take sim and put it back or restart or try anything possible then it may work only for sometime. Though I got a replacement the phone is not working. And you won't be able to return if the problem comes up on the eighth day as per the return policy. Money ends up wasted. Samsung doesn't respond at all. Their customer care numbers are never attended. Even their website help will not work for this particular model alone. DONOT buy this phone.
